    <p>Founded in 1982, Dre's Diner has been the go-to local spot in RÃ¸nneholtparken over four decades. Our
        focus has always been the quality of food. Quality does not only mean fine ingredients and attention to
        detail, it also means that we listen to our customers and shape our selection to the local demand.</p>

        <p>Our setting is humble but cozy, or "hyggeligt" as we say in Danish. We can host a mere 20 people, but we
            pay our utmost attention to every guest. You will feel welcome and cared for, and we can guarantee that our service is straight from the heart.</p>
