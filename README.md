command used for copying authentication templates to directory. Once copied we can make changes to the styling, and the content
cp -r ../.pip-modules/lib/python3.8/site-packages/allauth/templates/* ./templates

Due to error when creating user I was advised to implement the following in settings.py:
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = 'none'
![registration error](/static/images/readme-pictures/registration-error.png "error when registering a user")

28/10/2021 - for some reason Django logs user out when following link to reservation_detail.html.
Browser: Chrome
Console displays: "POST /accounts/logout/ HTTP/1.1" 302 0
User is logged back in when hitting the back button in browser
29/10/2021 - bug was fixed. Had to change the render function in ReservationDetail to include "user": User, instead of "user": User.username.
