command used for copying authentication templates to directory. Once copied we can make changes to the styling, and the content
cp -r ../.pip-modules/lib/python3.8/site-packages/allauth/templates/* ./templates

Due to error when creating user I was advised to implement the following in settings.py:
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = 'none'
![registration error](/static/images/readme-pictures/registration-error.png "error when registering a user")

28/10/2021 - for some reason Django logs user out when following link to reservation_detail.html.
Browser: Chrome
Console displays: "POST /accounts/logout/ HTTP/1.1" 302 0
User is logged back in when hitting the back button in browser
29/10/2021 - bug was fixed. Had to change the render function in ReservationDetail to include "user": User, instead of "user": User.username.

To implement:
- There is currently no identify check for canceling or updating reservations. If any user knows the author it's possible to type the url and execute either command. In the templates had issues with getting {% if user.username == reservation.author %} to work.
{{user.username}} and {{reservation.author}} display the same text, but the if statement won't execute.
